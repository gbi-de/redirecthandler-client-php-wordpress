Websites consist of several thousand pages and URLs, which are modified constantly. Removal of pages can cause "404-errors" (page not found). URLs that are reported as "404" can be subsequently added to URL-mappings and will thus operate as "redirects" (301) in the future. Redirecthandler is an on 404 Handling Routine divided into a backend service and small frontend includes.
